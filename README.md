# Asset Market Simulation System

## Introduction
I am a recently graduated theoretical physicist with a keen interest in quantitative finance. Given my experience in physics, I strongly believe that the best way to truly understand something as complex as real-world asset markets is to **build a model from scratch** that encapsulates the key features of the original system. I wanted to gain a deep, hands-on understanding of the full cycle of an asset market—how traders send orders, how a market maker processes and executes trades, how prices evolve dynamically, and how these prices influence future trades. The goal of this project is primarily to **build my own understanding** of these intricate dynamics.

One of the great things about this project is that it opens up **so many avenues for exploration**. Beyond simulating basic trading interactions, this serves as a **sandbox for testing algorithmic trading strategies**, a **platform for deep-dives into different market-making techniques**, and a **way to analyze clearing house mechanics**. It also allows for investigating **the conditions required for unique market events** like flash crashes or liquidity crises. This flexibility makes the project not just an educational tool but a potential launchpad for wide range of research into financial markets.

This project is a fully asynchronous **agent-based simulation** of a financial market, designed to model the complex interactions between independent trading agents and a centralized market maker. The system captures key elements of real-world trading, including **order flow, price formation, liquidity provision, and trade settlement**.

At its core, the simulation aims to **replicate emergent market behavior** by allowing many diverse agents to act **independently** and **simultaneously**, placing and executing trades through a **realistic order-matching mechanism**. Unlike simplistic financial models, this simulation incorporates:

- **Heterogeneous trading strategies** among agents
- **A dynamic bid-ask spread** determined by supply and demand
- **A centralized market maker** operating on **fixed tick intervals**
- **A clearing house** ensuring valid settlement of trades

The project is designed to explore **market microstructure, algorithmic trading strategies, and price discovery dynamics**. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for testing trading models, evaluating liquidity conditions, and analyzing market behaviors under various conditions.

## **System Architecture**

### **High-Level Overview**
The simulation consists of four primary components:

1. **Trading Agents** - Autonomous entities that place buy/sell orders based on individual strategies.
2. **Market Maker** - Centralized entity that matches orders and maintains the order book.
3. **Order Book** - A data structure that organizes bids and asks based on price-time priority.
4. **Clearing House** - Handles post-trade processing, ensuring that trades are correctly settled.

This architecture mirrors real-world financial markets, where **market makers provide liquidity**, **traders react to price movements**, and **a clearing house ensures smooth settlement**.

### **Why Asynchronous Design?**
In real-world markets, thousands of trades occur simultaneously, with orders arriving unpredictably. The simulation achieves this using **Python's `asyncio`** framework and **ZeroMQ (`zmq`)** for non-blocking communication:

- **Each trading agent runs as an independent asynchronous task**, submitting orders at unpredictable times.
- **The market maker processes incoming orders asynchronously** without blocking execution.
- **Order matching and clearing happen continuously**, ensuring a real-time flow of transactions.
- **ZeroMQ sockets enable fast, decentralized message passing**, avoiding synchronization bottlenecks.

This design choice is essential for maintaining a realistic simulation where market activity is fluid, **not limited by artificial time steps or batch processing**.

## **Component Details**

### **Trading Agents** (`TradingAgent` Class)
Trading agents represent various market participants, ranging from retail traders to institutional investors. Currently, these agents **submit random trades** with no intelligence, acting as placeholders for more sophisticated strategies in the future.

However, this system provides a foundation for implementing **a variety of algorithmic trading strategies**, including:
- **Trend Following** – Detecting and riding market momentum.
- **Mean Reversion** – Exploiting temporary deviations from an asset’s fair value.
- **Statistical Arbitrage** – Taking advantage of mispricings in correlated assets.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** – Making rapid, small trades to capture fleeting opportunities.
- **Reinforcement Learning-based Agents** – Using AI to adapt strategies dynamically.

Future work will focus on implementing these strategies to better understand the dynamics of algorithmic trading.

### **Market Maker**
The market maker plays a critical role in liquidity provision and price formation:
- **Maintains an order book** tracking outstanding bid and ask prices.
- **Matches buy/sell orders** based on price-time priority.
- **Provides real-time price discovery**, adjusting quotes in response to order flow.
- **Processes orders as they arrive**, ensuring minimal execution delay.


### **Order Book Implementation**
The order book is **the core mechanism for matching trades** and uses:
- **Priority queues (`heapq`)** for efficient bid-ask sorting.
- **Separate buy and sell order lists** ranked by price-time priority.
- **O(log n) insertion/removal** for real-time order execution.
- **Instant access to best bid/ask prices (`O(1)`)**.

This mirrors real-world electronic trading systems, where priority matching determines execution speed and market liquidity.

### **Limit Orders vs. Market Orders**
In financial markets, there are two main types of orders:
- **Limit Orders**: Traders specify a price at which they are willing to buy/sell. These orders go into the order book and wait for a matching counterparty.
- **Market Orders**: Traders execute immediately at the best available price.

The market maker handles these differently:
- **Limit orders are stored in the order book** until matched.
- **Market orders are executed immediately** by consuming available limit orders in the book.
- If a market order exceeds available liquidity at the best price, **slippage occurs**, meaning the trade executes at progressively worse prices.

This structure ensures that price formation is driven by genuine supply and demand.

### **Clearing House** (`ClearingHouse` Class)
To mimic the real world as closely as possible, this project includes a **clearing mechanism**. In the real markets, clearing house exist to ensure:
- **Trade validation** (e.g., no short-selling if leverage is disabled).
- **Order execution accounting** (i.e., funds/positions are correctly transferred between agents).
- **Post-trade settlement**, handling trade records and transaction logs.

In this simulation, the clearing house currently prints all the trades that need to be cleared, but it is a future extension of this project to build out a more realistic clearing house system connecting traders via cash and asset accounts.

## **Data Models**
Certain key objects are represented using Pydantic models for:
- Type safety and validation
- Easy serialization/deserialization
- Clear interface definition
- Network transmission

### Order Model
Key fields include:
- Account ID
- Side (Buy/Sell)
- Quantity
- Order Type (Market/Limit)
- Price (only for limit orders)
- Timestamp (when order was created)

### Clearing Order Model
Separate model for matched trades containing:
- Buyer account ID
- Seller account ID
- Execution price
- Quantity
